# Piano
HTML
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
The <html> element is the root of the document and includes the lang attribute for language declaration.
The <head> section contains metadata, including the character set, viewport settings for responsive design, and a link to an external CSS file (styles.css).
The <body> contains the main content, including:
A div with the id="piano" that serves as a container for the piano.
An anchor tag (<a>) for linking to your GitHub profile, styled with white color and bold text.
A div with the class keys that contains the individual piano keys, represented by divs with classes key and black--key.
CSS
Basic box-sizing rules are set for consistent layout.
The #piano ID styles the main piano container, setting dimensions, background color, margin, padding, and border-radius.
The .keys class defines the layout and background color for the keys container.
The .key class styles the white keys, setting dimensions, background color, position, margin, and border-radius.
The .key.black--key::after pseudo-element styles the black keys, giving them a distinct color and positioning.
The .logo class appears to be for a logo, but it seems unused in the provided HTML.
Media queries adjust the layout for different screen sizes, making the piano responsive.
Suggestions

CSS Enhancements: You might consider adding hover effects or animations for a more interactive experience. Also, adding some JavaScript functionality to play sounds when keys are clicked could enhance the simulation.

Media Queries: The media queries cover common screen sizes, but you may want to further test on various devices to ensure the layout is as expected.
